                Corporate governance and compliance requires balancing complicated competing interests under the 
                intense spotlight of regulatory, operational, fiduciary, political, communications and market factors. 
                It requires the application of judgment, legal analysis, and practical decision-making in a real-time 
                environment where decisions are likely to be second-guessed and sometimes reviewed by the courts. <br/> <br/>
                At CERTA, we understand that the best way to avoid a corporate governance crisis is to plan for it; 
                ensuring compliance and that often the most successfully resolved crises are the ones that no one 
                hears about. But when an issue is in the spotlight, we bring to bear an unparalleled array of resources 
                and expertise, including regulation, disclosure, corporate law, communications policy, compliance practices, 
                privacy, fiduciary duties, investor relations and experience based business judgment. <br/><br/>
                We are experienced in guiding boards of directors, special committees, and management on the full 
                range of governance issues that confront them. In fact, our multidisciplinary, business-focused 
                approach to addressing these issues has been relied upon by many local and regional companies. <br/><br/>

                In Rwanda, Medical law is a nascent area of practice. However, at CERTA our lawyers have the in-
                depth knowledge in medical malpractice, negligence and confidentiality of patient data. When
                handling this kind of sensitive cases, we are obliged by law and legal ethics to observe the rights
                and responsibilities of medical professionals and their patients. We have successfully
                represented hospitals, patients, and individual medical professionals in surgical claims, medical
                liability, and failure to observe medical procedures. Our lawyers are as well very conversant and
                highly experienced in advising the medical statutory bodies and doctors in matters related to
                professional misconduct, and breaches of ethical code.
